Candidate transient dispersion measure versus time for roughly 1 hour of fast imaging data at the VLA. Each panel shows a different time scale of the search, ranging from 10 ms to 160 ms (top to bottom). Huge numbers of candidates transients are discovered on longer timescales due to sub-second variability of source Jxx-xx (see \S \ref{fast}). Two small clusters of candidates are seen at the shortest timescale and are associated with RRAT 1925--16 (see \S \ref{rrat1925}).
