\subsection{J0628+09}

The detection and localization of J0628+09 was first reported in \cite{Law_2012}. Since the transient search software was completely redesigned since that first report, we reanalyzed this data set...

Observations were made in C configuration, with maximum baselines of roughly 3 km. We imaged these data with a beam size was 6.9\arcsec x 10.3\arcsec pixelated to cover xx times half-power width...
