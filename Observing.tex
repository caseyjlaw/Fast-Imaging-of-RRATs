\section{Observing and Analysis}

\subsection{Observations}

VLA observations (Table \ref{tab:obs}) were made in April 2012 in C configuration and December 2012/January 2013 in A configuration. All observations were made with 10 millisecond integrations, two polarizations, two spectral windows, and a total data recording rate of 75 MB s$^{-1}$. The two spectral windows started at 1372 and 1756 MHz with a width of 128 MHz and 64 channels each (2 MHz channel width).

    \begin{tabular}{ c c c c }
        Date & RRAT & Antenna Configuration & Duration \\ 
         23 April 2012 & J0628+09 & C & 30 min \\ 
         26 December 2012 -- 1 January 2013 & J1925-16 & A & 4 hours \\ 
         14 December 2012 -- 1 January 2013 & J1911+00 & A & 12 hours \\

 \subsection{Analysis}
 
 Pulse search was run at the Array Operations Center postprocessing cluster.
 
 The search pipeline is written largely in Python.
